# News/Updates Page Setup Instructions

## 🎉 News Page Successfully Created!

Your news/updates page has been successfully implemented and is ready to use. However, you need to update your database schema to enable all features.

## 🔧 Quick Setup (Required)

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Database schema needs to be updated" Error
- This means you haven't run the migration script yet
- Follow Step 1 above to update your database

### "Error fetching news: {}"
- Check your Supabase connection in `.env.local`
- Verify your database is accessible
- Run the debug script: `node debug-supabase.js`

### "42P10: there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification"
- This error occurred with the original migration script
- **Solution**: Use `minimal-migration.sql` instead of `simple-migration.sql`
- The minimal version avoids the ON CONFLICT issue

### Admin Features Not Working
- Ensure your user has `role = 'admin'` in the profiles table
- Check Row Level Security policies are properly set

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Run `node debug-supabase.js` to diagnose connection issues
3. Verify your environment variables are correct
4. Ensure the migration script ran successfully
