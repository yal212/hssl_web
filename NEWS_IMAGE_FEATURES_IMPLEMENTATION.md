### Database Migration
To enable the multiple content images feature, run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- Add content_images column to posts table
ALTER TABLE public.posts 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS content_images TEXT[];

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.posts.content_images IS 'Array of image URLs for news content gallery';

-- Update existing posts to have empty array for content_images if null
UPDATE public.posts 
SET content_images = '{}' 
WHERE content_images IS NULL;
```

### Storage Bucket Setup
The application will automatically create the `news-images` bucket when needed, but you can also create it manually in Supabase:

1. Go to Storage in your Supabase dashboard
2. Create a new bucket named `news-images`
3. Set it as public
4. Set file size limit to 10MB
5. Allow MIME types: `image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp`
